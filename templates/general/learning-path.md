## Example

```
I need help creating a learning path for:

**Topic**: Backend Development with Node.js and Express
**Current Level**: Beginner - I know JavaScript basics and have built simple frontend apps

**Learning Goals**:
- Build and deploy full-stack web applications
- Understand RESTful API design
- Work with databases (SQL and NoSQL)
- Implement authentication and authorization
- Deploy applications to production
- Be ready for junior backend developer roles

**Time Commitment**: 10-15 hours per week
**Timeline**: 3-4 months

**Learning Preferences**:

- [x] Courses (if free or affordable)
- [ ] Books

**Specific Focus Areas**:
- RESTful API development
- Database design and operations
- Authentication/Authorization

- Tools: Have a laptop, GitHub account, can use free hosting tiers

Please provide:
1. Prerequisites check (do I need more JS fundamentals?)
2. Structured 4-phase learning path (Foundation → Intermediate → Advanced → Specialization)
3. Specific resources:
   - Free courses (freeCodeCamp, YouTube channels)
   - Documentation (Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL)
   - Paid courses if truly valuable
4. Hands-on projects:
   - Phase 1: Todo API
   - Phase 2: Blog API with auth
   - Phase 3: E-commerce backend
   - Phase 4: Real-time chat app
5. Topics in order:
   - Node.js fundamentals
   - Express framework
   - RESTful API design
   - SQL and PostgreSQL
   - MongoDB
   - Authentication (JWT)
   - Testing (Jest)
   - Deployment (Heroku, AWS)
6. Time estimates: 3-4 weeks per phase
7. Assessment checkpoints after each project
8. Next steps: Advanced topics, microservices, or job hunting
```

## Tips

1. **Be specific about your current level** with examples
2. **Define clear, measurable goals** not just "learn X"
3. **Mention time constraints** realistically
4. **State learning preferences** to get suitable resources
5. **Include budget** so recommendations fit your resources
6. **Request projects** to build real skills
7. **Ask for assessment points** to track progress
8. **Specify focus areas** if you don't need everything
9. **Request milestones** to maintain motivation
10. **Ask about next steps** for continued growth
