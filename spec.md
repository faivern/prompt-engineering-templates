# Project Spec: Todo API

## Functional Requirements
- Create, read, update, and delete todos.
- Each todo includes: `title`, `description`, and `status`.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Fast response times (under 200ms for typical requests).
- Basic security using input validation and error handling.
- API documentation provided via Swagger or similar tool.

## Architecture Choices
- **Backend Framework:** Node.js with Express  
- **Database:** SQLite (lightweight and file-based)  
- **API Design:** RESTful API with JSON responses  

## Data Handling
- Data is stored locally in a SQLite database file.  
- Each todo record is uniquely identified by an auto-incremented ID.  
- Simple CRUD logic with validation for required fields.

## Error Handling Strategies
- Use Express middleware for centralized error handling.  
- Return consistent error responses in JSON format (with `error` and `message` keys).  
- Log server-side errors for debugging.

## Testing Plan
- Unit tests for all API endpoints.  
- Mock data to simulate multiple scenarios.  
- Integration tests to verify database operations.  
- Manual testing via Postman or similar tool.

**Purpose:** This file defines the core system requirements, architecture, and testing strategy for a simple REST-based Todo API.  
*Use this as a lightweight template for documenting small projects or prototypes.*
